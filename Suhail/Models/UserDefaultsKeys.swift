/// All UserDefaults keys used across the app — single source of truth.
///
/// These values store lightweight app/session state that must survive
/// app restarts or force quits. They are not part of the main SwiftData models.
///
/// | Key | Type | Set By | Cleared By | Why is it stored? |
/// |-----|------|--------|------------|-------------------|
/// | `appLanguageSet` | Bool | `DesertApp.init` | Never | Prevents the one-time language setup from running on every launch. |
/// | `appleLanguages` | [String] | `DesertApp.init` | Never | Forces the app to start in English until Arabic layout support is complete. |
/// | `anonymousUserId` | String | `FirebaseManager` | Never | Keeps the same Firebase anonymous user identity across launches so trips remain linked to the same user. |
/// | `activeTripId` | String | `LocationManager` | `LocationManager.stopTracking` | Allows GPS tracking to resume if iOS terminates and later relaunches the app during an active trip. |
/// | `lastSavedLat/Lng` | Double | `TripSessionManager` | `clearActiveTripFromSettings` | Remembers the last GPS point saved locally to avoid creating duplicate track points after a restart. |
/// | `savedPointsCount` | Int | `TripSessionManager` | `clearActiveTripFromSettings` | Continues GPS point numbering from the correct index after a restart. |
/// | `lastUploadDate` | Double | `TripSessionManager` | `clearActiveTripFromSettings` | Preserves the last upload timestamp so the 30-minute fallback upload rule still works after a restart. |
/// | `lastUploadedLat/Lng` | Double | `TripSessionManager` | `clearActiveTripFromSettings` | Remembers the last uploaded coordinate to correctly measure movement distance after a restart. |
/// | `isProductionEnabled` | Bool | `TripSummaryView` (DEBUG only) | Never | Controls whether Firebase uploads are active during development — off by default, writes to `_trips_dev` when on. |
